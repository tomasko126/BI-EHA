# BI-EHA
FIT CTU - 16/17 - BI-EHA (Ethical Hacking)

## Course overview
The course gives a professional and academic introduction to computer and information security using the ethical hacking approach,
which enables improved defence thanks to adopting an attacker mindset when discovering vulnerabilities,
hands-on experience with different attacks, facilitates linking theory and practice in significant areas of one's digital literacy,
and can therefore be utilized by (future) security professionals, (informed) decision-makers, (savvy) users and developers alike.

## Goals
Goal of this course was to choose either some university web app/service, or any other application out there.
After we had chosen the app, we had to perform an analysis of the application, try to find any security bugs and make a detailed security report.

I chose the F-Security Key Password Manager application - [here](https://github.com/tomasko126/F-Secure-KEY-audit), you can take a look at the results of the analysis.
